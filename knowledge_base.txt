Sign Protocol Overview
Sign Protocol is an omni-chain attestation protocol that enables users to create, store, and verify digital attestations across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, TON, Aptos, Polygon, BNB Chain, and more. Launched in 2020 as EthSign, it evolved to simplify trust and verification in Web3 using zero-knowledge cryptography and digital signatures. It powers EthSign and TokenTable, with over 6 million attestations created and $4 billion distributed to 40 million wallets as of April 2025. Backed by Binance Labs and Sequoia Capital.

Key Facts
Attestations: Cryptographically signed claims linked to wallet addresses, used for identity, credentials, or agreements. Example: Verifying a user’s KYC status without revealing personal data.
Schemas: Data structures defining attestation formats (e.g., {userId: string, verified: boolean}). Users register schemas to standardize attestations.
$SIGN Token: Native token with 10 billion total supply, 1.2 billion circulating (April 2025). Used for transaction fees, DAO governance, and incentives for attesters/verifiers.
EthSign: Decentralized e-signing platform for legally binding agreements. Over 250,000 documents signed as of April 2025. Features PDF uploads, cross-chain signatures (Bitcoin, EVM, TON, Solana), AES-256-GCM/ECIES encryption, and legal templates (SAFE, SAFT).
TokenTable: Token distribution platform managing $4 billion to 40 million wallets across 200+ projects (e.g., Starknet, ZetaChain). Includes Airdrop Pro (large-scale), Airdrop Lite (up to 100,000 users), and Unlocker (vesting schedules).
Sign Pass: Digital ID solution for identity verification, live in 3 countries (e.g., Barbados). Used for KYC, membership, or gated dApp access.
Metrics: 6 million+ attestations created, $4 billion distributed, 250,000+ documents signed, Sign Pass active in 3 countries.

Members participate via X with orange PFPs, host events like SignRun, and earn Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) for contributions. The upcoming Sign App (Q2 2025) will offer 3x rewards for builders. The community rejects Sybil attacks, with 60% of $SIGN reserved for future growth.
